Instructions:

* You need Processing 2.0a5 or later, we built trunk from SVN.
* You need Apache Ant to build.

* Set properties in build.xml
    * The name of your mode (lib.name) must end in "Mode" (e.g. MyFancyMode) otherwise it won't work.
    * Set the path to your processing jars (core.jar, pde.jar)
    * If you want to automatically install your mode (target: install ), set the path to your modes folder (typically a folder named "modes" inside your sketchbook folder)
    * If you want to run processing after building (target: run), set the path to your processing executable.

* Other libraries that you need in your mode can be placed in "lib". They will be added to the classpath for building and bundled with your mode.

* Ant Targets:
    * build: builds your mode, creates a folder containing the mode in "dist". This can be put into the modes folder inside your sketchbook.
    * install: builds your mode and copies it to your modes folder.
    * run: builds and installs your mode, then runs processing.
